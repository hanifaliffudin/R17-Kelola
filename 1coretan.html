      Currently, many enterprises are using Cloud Computing which is a
      technology to store company data on internet servers. Cloud Computing is
      considered easier to use, faster and more secure. This technology
      development in Cloud has led to a system called Virtual Data Center (VDC)
      which can simplify the work & operational system in a company.

    <p>
      Here are some interesting facts about Virtual Data Center (VDC):
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Can be used as an infrastructure to build applications</li>
      <li>Can be used to expand on-premises resources</li>
      <li>
        Can be used as a secondary system for Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) needs
      </li>
      <li>Can reduce the company's costs for physically providing servers</li>
    </ol>

      Virtual Data Center is a collection of cloud infrastructure specifically
      designed for company's needs such as computing, storage memory and
      bandwidth. This Virtual Data Center is hosted on the Public Cloud and
      based on VMware vCloud technology, which provides full compatibility with
      any VMware case. Virtual data center, High Availability (HA) provided by
      clusterware. Each cluster installation requires shared storage.

      Visual Data Center uses network technologies such as encryption,
      tunneling, private IP addressing and virtual LAN (VLAN) to provide a Cloud
      environment, Virtual Data Center is a very flexible Cloud server and can
      be used for large-scale needs. In running Disaster Recovery Virtual Data
      Center do it automatically. Once management decides to trigger Disaster
      Recovery run the proper recovery process in VMware Site Recovery Manager
      and no manual intervention is required. With the Virtual Data Center, of
