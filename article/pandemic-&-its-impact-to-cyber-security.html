                  The coronavirus pandemic has created new challenges for
                  businesses as they adjust to an operating model in which
                  working from home has become the ‘new normal’. Companies are
                  speeding up their digital transformation, and cybersecurity is
                  now a serious issue. The reputational, operational, and legal
                  could be considerable if cybersecurity risks are abandoned.
                  This article analyse the impact of COVID-19 on cyber risk
                </p>
                <p>
                  The restrictions imposed by governments in response to the
                  coronavirus pandemic have encouraged employees to work from
                  home, and even ‘stay at home’. As a result, technology has
                  become even more important in both our working and personal
                  lives. Despite this rise of technology need, it is noticeable
                  that many organisations still do not provide a ’cyber-safe’
                  remote-working environment. Where business meetings have
                  traditionally been held in-person, most now take place
                  virtually.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The cyber security industry has faced two major sets of
                  challenges over the last twelve months. The attacks and
                  exploits affecting companies and their customers have focused
                  attention on supply chain risk, but the impact of the
                  coronavirus pandemic has been felt more broadly across cyber
                  security domains and disciplines. For example according to
                  National Cyber and Crypto agency in Indonesia (BSSN) There are
                  88.4 millions Cyber Attack for the last 4 months. Moreover, It
                  is stated that 83% company in Indonesia easily to get hack
                </p>
                <h4>
                  <u
                    >Are businesses prepared for the new cybersecurity risks?
                  </u>
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Remote working has created challenges for many small and
                  medium-sized companies: they have not been sufficiently
                  prepared for the upsurge in sophisticated cyberattacks, and
                  much progress is needed to raise cybersecurity awareness.
                  Before the pandemic, some companies were opposed to allowing
                  remote working and especially when it came to accessing
                  confidential data (e.g. banking client personal data). In only
                  a short period of time, companies had to increase their
                  capacity and capabilities for remote working. Unfortunately,
                  cybersecurity was not always a key priority in the fast
                  deployment of remote working capabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, some companies do not check that personal devices
                  are equipped with standard security protections before their
                  employees access corporate data, relying on virtual private
                  network (VPN) technologies to do a job that they are not by
                  default designed for. There are ways that companies can
                  implement security measures without being intrusive. For
                  example, host checking is a technology that validates
                  individual requirements on personal devices before allowing
                  access to corporate applications. When vulnerabilities in VPNs
                  are discovered and patches are produced to deal with them, it
                  is important to apply the patches in a timely manner, where
                  possible.

                  <u>How companies and employees can increase cybersecurity</u>
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Employees working from home and using their personal computer
                  (and even those using a corporate-owned device) should
                  implement essential cyber hygiene practices. These include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Antivirus protection</b>. Employees should be provided
                    with a license to antivirus and malware software for use on
                    their personal computers. Although this does not provide
                    failsafe protection, it eliminates many low-level attacks.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Cybersecurity awareness</b>. Staff should be briefed on
                    best practices and procedures to regulate the sending of
                    emails or other content to private email addresses and/or
                    cloud storage.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Home network security</b>. Employees should ensure that
                    their home Wi-Fi is protected by a strong password.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Identify weak spots</b>. All IT systems have weaknesses.
                    Companies should run tests to identify them and patch the
                    most critical vulnerabilities as soon as possible. This can
                    take the form of vulnerability scanning, or various type of
                    penetration testing exercises. Additionally hardening of
                    components of the technical infrastructure should be
                    performed.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>More advanced measures that can be taken include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Prepare for attacks. In these high-risk times, companies are
                    advised to carry out frequent cyber crisis simulation
                    exercises to prepare their response to a cyberattack.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Zero Trust. CISOs and CIOs should consider implementing a
                    zero trust approach to cybersecurity. This is a security
                    model where only authenticated and authorized users and
                    devices are permitted access to applications and data. It
                    challenges the concept of “access granted by default”.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Apply new technology and tools. Companies can use advanced
                    tools such as host checking (a tool to check the security
                    posture of an endpoint before authorizing access to
                    corporate information systems) to reinforce the security of
                    remote working.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Risk management. Businesses can apply governance, risk and
                    compliance (GRC) solutions for improved risk management. GRC
                    solutions provide a detailed view of the company’s risk
                    exposure and help link together the various risk disciplines
                    (e.g. cybersecurity, operational risks, business
                    continuity).
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
                <p>
                  Companies should be proactive in addressing the threats, and
                  plan ways of preventing successful cyberattacks rather than
                  responding when they occur. However although prevention
                  measures are important, there is also a need for cyberattack
                  detection, response and recovery capabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are ways to reduce the possibility and impact of a
                  cyberattack, but it requires focused action and planning.
                  Companies need to make their remote working practices
                  resilient to cyberattacks and enhance their development and
                  application of security measures.
